What is the meaning of life?

I'll give you my answer - there is no meaning. At an early part of my life (teenage existential crisis?), I saw no real meaning to the world but I still recognized that I wanted to find some meaning. Without that innate desire to find meaning, I couldn't keep moving forward and there would be no point for me to live, right?

But isn't that pointless? Trying to find meaning when you know that you won't find it? Isn't that _absurd_?

I never knew there was a term for this until I came across a philosophy book that mentioned [absurdism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism). As I read more and more about absurdism, I was fascinated with the theory and decided to read Albert Camus' _The Stranger_, a book well known for its emphasis on the meaningless of life and the irrationality of the world.

#### Some spoilers ahead!

The very first two sentences of the story hooked me in immediately:

<figure>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Maman died today. Or yesterday maybe, I don't know.</p>
		<footer>
			<cite>—Mersault</cite>
		</footer>
	</blockquote>
</figure>

I immediately thought to myself - how do you not know when your mother died? The protagonist of the story, Meursault, was an extremely indifferent man who had little regard for the universe around him. Later in the story he is imprisoned for the murder of another man and only in person he comes to the realization that the universe is equally indifferent to him, so whether he lives or dies has no importance. It's at this point where he reaches true happiness - accepting the fact that death is inevitable and living life for what it is, making the most of his remaining days before execution.

I was left speechless through reading the entire novel - no other book had such an impact on me as much as _The Stranger_. Much of what keeps me going forward today and what helps me keep at ease with the world around me is the fact that death is inevitable. We have to make the most of life while we can. Find your own meaning. If we just sit idly by doing nothing until we're of old age, what then? I suppose that's one of way of living life, but you'd better not regret not doing more when you were younger because that would be on you.

We are absurd. The world is absurd. Everything is absurd. But we have to embrace the Absurd. You may never find the true meaning of life, but the search in itself is meaningful, and that's all we really need.
