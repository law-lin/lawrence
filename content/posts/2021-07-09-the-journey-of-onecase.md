In March 2020, right during the beginning of quarantine, my friend Jason and I got together on Discord to brainstorm random project ideas.


The first one we thought of was Ideagrate, a social planning app to streamline the planning process. We thought of taking parts from Venmo (you get to see what other people pay each other), Trello (kanban boards, task assignment), and other social media (chatting and interacting with other people) to piece them together to make productivity "addictive".

Here's one of our very early, messy sketches of what it would look like.

From March to May, we mostly spent what free time we had on thinking about how we would approach the app. During this time, we decided on using the name **OneCase** instead, because it was more catchy and easy to input.



At this point in time, I had virtually 0 web development experience. DOM? NoSQL? Hooks? All of these terms made no sense to me at the beginning, but after spending about 2 months during the summer learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and Firebase, I was able to build a working prototype of OneCase all by myself by the end of summer. If you asked me to explain the code and technologies to you then, I could definitely do it (who couldn't after hours of endless debugging?). 



You can take a look at our prototype [https://theshowcase.app/lawlin](here). This is my profile, with two categories you can check out. This basically ended up being more like a portfolio site than a social planning app, so we had gone wrong somewhere down the line. Once summer ended and school started, there wasn't much time for OneCase until the winter break.
