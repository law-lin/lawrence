I'm currently a software engineer intern at Rippling. Previously, I've done software engineering internships at LinkedIn (2022), IBM (2021), at a startup called Goodnation (2020), and at a non-profit called Open Learning Exchange (2020). I've also done a product management internship at Roblox (2022).

Some apps I've published are:

- [Spark](https://linktr.ee/usesparkapp), a friendmaking app for college students
- [OneCase](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/onecase-social-accountability/id1604737461), a social accountability app to help get yourself productive.

Some of my interests include web development (I'd love to learn more about frontend infra) and edtech.

In my free time, I enjoy building LEGO sets, gaming, and reading.
