I'm currently a computer science student at Stony Brook University. I've done software engineering internships at LinkedIn (2022), IBM (2021), at a startup called Goodnation (2020), and at a non-profit called Open Learning Exchange (2020). I also worked as a software developer for Stony Brook University's Department of Computer Science, developing a new system to handle internal workflows. Right now, I'm working on multiple web and mobile social-oriented projects, namely [Spark](https://linktr.ee/usesparkapp), a friendmaking app for college students and [OneCase](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/onecase-social-accountability/id1604737461), a social accountability app to help get yourself productive.

Some of my interests include web development, cloud computing, and edtech.

In my free time, I enjoy building LEGO sets (mainly Star Wars), gaming, and reading.
