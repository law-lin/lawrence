I'm currently a CS student at Stony Brook University (BS '21, MS '22). I've done software engineering internships at IBM (2021), at a startup called Goodnation (2020), and at a non-profit called Open Learning Exhchange (2020). I'm also a software developer for Stony Brook University's Department of Computer Science, working on a new system to handle internal workflows. Right now, I'm working on multiple web and mobile social-oriented projects, namely [Spark](https://linktr.ee/usesparkapp). Spark currently has over 200 active users!

In my free time, I enjoy building LEGO sets (mainly Star Wars), gaming, and reading.

You can check out some of my projects [here](/pages/projects) or more on my [GitHub](https://github.com/law-lin).
