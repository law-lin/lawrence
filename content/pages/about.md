I'm currently a CS student at Stony Brook University (BS '21, MS '22). I've done SWE internships at IBM (2021) and at a startup called Goodnation (2020). Right now, I'm working on multiple web and mobile social-oriented projects.

You can check out some of my projects [here](/pages/projects) or more on my [GitHub](https://github.com/law-lin).
